# Session: 2026-01-31

## Accomplished
- [x] Code review of entire project (9 files)
- [x] Fix promo window time (11:00 AM → 11:59 PM PT) in email template, config, and alert state
- [x] Add JSON parse error handling in Cloudflare Worker
- [x] Commit v1.7.1
- [x] Push to GitHub
- [x] Deploy worker to Cloudflare

## In Progress
- None

## Blocked
- None

## Decisions Made
- Push before deploy: Safer to backup code to GitHub before deploying worker
- Return 400 for parse errors: Better than generic 500 for malformed requests

## Next Session
- Consider fixing MEDIUM issues from review:
  - Restrict CORS to specific origins
  - Improve email validation regex
  - Extract duplicate safe_print() to config.py
  - Pin exact versions in requirements.txt
